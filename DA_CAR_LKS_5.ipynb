He saw that some metrics and dimensions were not very clear, also he did not like some of the graphs formatting.\n","\n","You should make a copy of the final dashboard from the Hands On task to clean it up, make it more interactive and advanced. Feel free to work with anything from formatting to adding completely new graphs and insights. Maybe you could utilize some of the techniques you have learned in the previous sprints as well.\n","\n","As an alternative you can come up with a completely new dashboard if you wish. The only requirement is that you use the same [AdventureWorks company data](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db) to construct your dashboard. Once again, remember that we are giving you some freedom in your Graded Task, though we expect you to utilize tools you have learned as well as making sure that you follow guidelines you have learned in this sprint. Make sure you take into consideration the dashboard structure and ways to make sure the user understands the data you intend to be understood. For this you will have to come up with your own insights about data and make sure those insights tell a consistent and coherent story.\n","\n","- Write SQL queries to extract needed data, these queries should be well documented, with indentation and provided as custom queries in Looker Studio dashboard.\n","- Provide your analysis in Looker Studio or other data visualization tool of your choice the main requirement being that you use [AdventureWorks company data](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db)\n","- You need to present at least one additional insight that either reinforces (or replaces the graphs in the original graph). Your audience is interested in business insights and your role is to identify and tell them a story via visuals.\n","- Explore the data. See whether there are interesting data points that can give more insights than previously established in the Hands On task.\n","- Provide analytical insights, what are the drawbacks of this analysis, what further analysis could you recommend?\n","\n","*Tip: to make valuable business insights, itâ€™s almost never enough to only look at the data. It is often very beneficial to do some additional research about the industry and the business as well.*\n","\n","## Evaluation criteria for Graded project submission:\n","\n","- SQL is nicely formatted and there are no logic errors in queries.\n","- DataSources connected to the dashboard are well formatted, naming conventions are clear and calculated fields have relevant names\n","- You have provided a dashboard which is user friendly and interactive enough to pull some more insights by the users themselves\n","- You have understood various techniques to be used in Looker Studio (or other tool) correctly and managed to improve the original dashboard / provide useful insights from your own dashboard\n","- Analysis, findings and main points clearly structured.\n","\n","*During a task review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.*\n","\n","**Sample questions:**\n","- How does data blending in Looker Studio work? What do you always have to have in mind? \n","- How on a very general level should dashboards be structured? What information should be provided at the top of the dashboard vs information provided at the bottom?\n","- Why is providing preattentive attributes important when constructing dashboards?\n","- Can you think of situations where having a less interactive dashboard is more suitable than having a heavily customizable interactive dashboard?\n","\n","## Submission\n","Upload all solution files for this graded task to your GitHub repository using the \"Add File\" function.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vENWQYS2Mtoe"}}]}
