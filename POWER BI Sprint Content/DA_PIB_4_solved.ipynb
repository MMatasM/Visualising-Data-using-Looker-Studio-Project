        "## Sprint: Visualising Data using Power BI\n",
        "## Part 1: Hands-On Practise Solved\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your role\n",
        "\n",
        "You are an analyst in the AdventureWorks company in the Data Ops department, which is responsible for fulfilling internal data needs, from adding and integrating new data sources, writing ETLs, and also developing dashboards that other teams would utilize.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since you are well-known across the company as the go-to guy for making amazing interactive dashboards, your colleague from the Sales team visits you. Recently, he has provided the Sales Director with the sales data analysis you did in the previous module (Spreadsheets sprint). However they have realized that this data would be something they would like to track overtime, and they need it to be updated automatically. For this reason, he is looking for a person to transfer this analysis into the dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data\n",
        "\n",
        "As in one of the previous sprints, you will be using [AdventureWorks company data](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?authuser=3&project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db), which is readily available on BigQuery. You have already analyzed part of this data while doing Spreadsheets Sprint, though you got more familiar with databases once you moved to SQL sprint, so the data is already familiar to you. In case you need this data, you can always refer to the [schema of this database](https://i0.wp.com/improveandrepeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AdvWorksOLTPSchemaVisio.png?ssl=1).\n",
        "\n",
        "As you may have already guessed from the Hands-On task intro, we will be using charts and graphs, which you have already done in the Spreadsheets sprint. Since we aim to make sure that you have the skills to create dashboards, we will be providing SQL queries in some cases. In other cases, you may need to connect directly to BigQuery tables and maybe blend them together. The main purpose of this Hand On task is not to get more practice writing SQL queries but to get more practice developing interactive dashboards, which would be easy to understand and draw insights from.\n",
        "\n",
        "While creating this dashboard, imagine that data in [AdventureWorks db](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?authuser=3&project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db) is being daily. General advice when constructing a dashboard is to always think about the user and how you would look into the dashboard yourself if you were the Director of Sales. How would you interact with the dashboard, and what fields would you like to filter?\n",
        "\n",
        "If you experience issues with connecting data sources, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWHOrplrgdYOuUmJsb5i7VHXnkyaMIXMOR7DwlAm7d8/edit#heading=h.61wommm1sne4) are some instructions for that.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Monday\n",
        "\n",
        "On Monday, you start with adding some main KPIs to the top of your dashboard: Orders Count, Total Sales ($), Average Order Value (AOV) and Avg. Days to Ship. For the last 2 KPIs, you will need to implement custom calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "You then create 2 additional charts showing monthly sales:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Monthly sales by year, month\n",
        "2. Monthly sales by month, year over year\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, you start by connecting the `salesorderheader` table from [AdventureWorks database](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?authuser=3&project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db!3ssalesorderheader). Make sure you use PowerBI Connector for this. Initially, you will need to authorize access to this particular database.For this make sure you use Turing College provided Google account. Once authorized, make sure you connect only the `salesorderheader` table. You will be provided with two options: connect live data or create extract. It is up to you which one you use, but make sure you understand what each implies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, you create your KPI graphs as big numbers on top of the dashboard, followed by line charts for monthly sales. Of course, you include a date range filter at the top of the dashboard, so your users could filter all these graphs by their selected dates.\n",

You decide to utilize PowerB’sI advanced options functionality when connecting data sources. You know that sales reasons reside in a separate table called `salesreason`, so you decide to write a custom SQL query to pull this data. Also to reduce the strain of pulling all the data, you decide to aggregate it on a year-month basis.\n",

Also, you notice that in roughly 20% of orders, more than 1 reason is assigned to a sale. To mitigate this, you decide to pull only data which actually has some sale reasons assigned.
