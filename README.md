# Tableau/Power BI Sprint ðŸ“š

Well done on completing the Visualising Data sprint! Upon completion of this sprint, all learners get access to the content of the other Visualisation Tool sprints provided by Turing College. While completely optional, you may want to look over it to get familiar with even more visualisation tools.

You can find the full content of our Tableau and POWER BI sprints in the provided folders.

File DA_2_1_5_solved.ipynb contains tips for the graded task of this sprint and sample solutions.

.ipynb files can usually be open directly via Github, but in some rare cases, it might not work and show a blank page. In this case, you can use a popular IDE like VS Code or https://colab.research.google.com/ to open the files after downloading them.
