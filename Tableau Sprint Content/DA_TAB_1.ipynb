You will learn how to approach different visualizations’ tasks as a data analyst.\n","\n","By now you have probably realized that results of your analysis need to be communicated clearly and the needed information should be presented in a comprehensible way. For a data analyst, getting the data right is but a first step in the process – it is often equally (if not more) important to be able to visualize the findings in a well thought out and balanced way. \n","\n","Visualization is a craft that can sometimes be overlooked with analysts either under-developing and not bringing enough value from the data, or, on the contrary, over-developing, creating heavy visualizations with a lot of features that may not be relevant for the business task the visualization was aimed at solving. No matter how you are presenting your data and findings, whether this is a presentation, a dashboard or a report, you always have to keep in mind who is your audience and what story you are trying to tell. One very important part of this is understanding how to use various data visualization tools and how.\n","\n","\n","All practical exercises and information will be based on Tableau data visualization software. It is an excellent tool to start learning advanced reporting for data analyst as it has multiple benefits:\n","- Has big community behind with active participation and sharing of graphs\n","- Tableau Public provides easy sharing options of the dashboards on the cloud\n","- Has wide range of chart types\n","- Provides data joining capabilities for all kinds of data sources\n","- Is one of the most widely used visualization tools\n","\n","If you still struggle with the bigger picture my advice would be to start by checking some [Tableau Dashboard examples](https://www.tableau.com/dashboard-examples), which will provide you with better ideas of what they can look like.\n","\n","Understanding Tableau mechanics and having more hands-on experience on different visualizations will give you a good start with any of the other reporting tools such as Looker or Looker Studio, PowerBI and others should you encounter them in your job. From our own experience we can testify that if you have learnt one data visualization tool really well it is relatively easy to switch to a new one. What matters most is understanding how to build dashboards and what kind of things can be done with them.\n","\n","We will be alternating between theory and practice by reading chapters from books and getting practical exercises in Tableau. Theory part will be covered by a short book By Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic called Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals. This is a great book with solid visualization examples. Even though this book does not focus on any particular data visualization software tool it will provide you with a great foundation of how your dashboards should look going forward in this sprint. Then we’ll go through 3 great videos on Youtube prepared by “Alex The Analyst” channel which will provide you with Tableau basics you will need to dig deeper into a bit more advanced topics of building dashboards. The 1st video will focus on Tableau installation, using Tableau Public and on how to create your first visualization by connecting data sources. Though if you already have Tableau installed on your computer you can skip the first part of the video tutorial. In the 2nd video you will learn how to use calculated fields and bins. This will be followed by the 3rd video providing further details on different visualizations in tableau. \n","\n","## Key Resources\n","[Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/storytelling-with-data/9781119002253/)\n","  - Chapter 1-3\n","\n","[Tableau Tutorials For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8GwbqoVmo_5zuhOa0Tcl3xC)\n","  - Video 1: [How to Install Tableau and Create First Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xv1KvCMF1Q)\n","  - Video 2: [How to use Calculated Fields and Bins in Tableau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6qxxtWkaUg)\n","  - Video 3: [How to Create Visualizations in Tableau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebjDwX8sUMk)\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xqb_q4oKMKCc"}}]}
